In addition to psychology and Spanish, I also enjoy developing my technology skills. I created this website for a class I took to learn more about coding and computing in general. I have also taken a class on Generative AI, for which I created an ePortfolio to demonstrate what I learned during the semester. To learn more, visit my ePortfolio here!
