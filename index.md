In addition to studying psychology and Spanish, I also enjoy developing my technology skills. I created this personal website for a class I took about computing as a way to gain basic coding experience. I have also taken a class on Generative AI, for which I created an ePortfolio to display my work. To learn more, visit my ePortfolio here!
