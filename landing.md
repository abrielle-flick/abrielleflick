			<h2>Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<p>From farm work to formal office experience, my personal and professional involvements have equipped me with a wide variety of skills and values. While psychology is my passion, I also enjoy working with animals and being involved in the Notre Dame Band, as described below.</p>

					<h3>The Notre Dame Band</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I play the trumpet for various band ensembles at Notre Dame, including the marching band. I also work as a FUIC for the band, which means I work with other FUICs to fit marching band members in uniforms and maintain the uniforms. We inventory uniforms, perform uniform repairs, and prepare uniforms for cleaning. Working as a FUIC has allowed me to gain experience working on a team and develop a friendly and professional demeanor in the workplace. Performing uniform repairs has also given me the opportunity to work on my sewing skills--and sewing happens to be another one of my hobbies!</p>

					<h3>Health Plus Indiana</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During the summer, I am a volunteer intern for Health Plus Indiana (HPI), a nonprofit that provides support services to the South Bend Community, including medical services, housing, and meals. My time at HPI has given me many opportunities to interact with members of the South Bend community, practice working in a professional environment, and learn more about HIV/AIDS and how HPI's services impact people who have been affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>

					<h3>Prairie Winds Nature Farm</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Last year, I visited Prairie Winds Nature Farm for one of my classes, which required us to make two trips to the farm--one orientation visit and one service visit. I enjoyed my time on the farm and the work I did for service, which included different farm maintenance tasks, and I wanted to visit the farm again, so I volunteered there a few times over the summer before my sophomore year. Working on the farm allowed me to learn more about nature and the animals I interacted with, as well as general information about the farm and how to complete the tasks I helped with. My time on the farm also allowed me to form relationships with people I met and learn more about how the farm impacts the community. I intend to volunteer at the farm again this summer so that I can maintain the connections I made and continue to immerse myself in nature.</p>
