I recently ran the 2025 Holy Half Marathon! I ran the Holy Half last year and completed it in a little over two hours, so my goal this year was to break 2 hours. I finished at 1 hour and 59 minutes, just breaking 2 hours. I intend to run the Holy Half every year I am an undergrad at Notre Dame, so I have two more to go!
