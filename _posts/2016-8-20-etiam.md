At the beginning of last summer, I traveled with Notre Dame's international concert tour band to South Africa. We performed in Cape Town, Knysna, and Entabeni. This trip was my first time out of the country, and I will be traveling again in a few weeks for this year's international tour to Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia.
