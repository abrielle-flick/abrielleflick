I graduated from Mishawaka High School in June 2023. At Mishawaka High School, I did marching band and ran track and cross country. I was also a member of the National Honor Society and wrote for my school's newspaper, The Alltold.

I am currently finishing my sophomore year of college at the University of Notre Dame. I am majoring in psychology with a supplementary major in Spanish. Here at Notre Dame, I am a part of the band and the ballroom dancing club. I expect to graduate from Notre Dame in May 2027. After earning my bachelor's degree, I intend to pursue graduate school to continue studying psychology.
